# PIR-Home-Security
A personal project of a home security system which was implemented mainly with the use of a PIR sensor and an esp8266

The aforementioned circuit implements a home security system using an infrared sensor for intrusion detection and the ESP8266 Nodemcu 12 
integrated circuit ESP8266 for data processing and communication with the Blynk cloud. By using the WiFi included in the integrated the user is able to remotely control 
the system from a computer or mobile phone via the Blynk console or Android app.
In addition, even if the user is in the house where the circuit is installed he can still be alerted through the sound produced by the beeper with each activation of the sensor.
